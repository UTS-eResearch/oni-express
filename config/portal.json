      "text": "<h4>PURPOSE</h4><p>This document outlines: </p><ul><li>The approval and document preparation processes for new applications added to the UTS Library of Successful Grants(â€˜the Libraryâ€™); </li><li>The provision of access to the Library; </li><li>The responsibilities of those administering the Library; </li><li>And the responsibilities of UTS staff when accessing the Library.  </li></ul><h4>OVERVIEW</h4>  <p>The Library is an electronic resource which contains external UTS grant applications that have been funded. The Library is a resource used to assist UTS researchers in framing, structuring, and developing their own grant applications.  </p><h4>SCOPE</h4><p>This procedure applies to those administering the Library, all UTS researchers and professional staff who access the Library and the researchers who consent to their successful application being included in the Library.  </p><h4>PROCEDURE</h4>  <p>Successful funding applications across HERDC categories 1-4, tenders, and successful prize and award applications, will be made available within the Library pending approval from the Lead Investigator/Applicant.   </p><p>Library contents will be reviewed periodically to ensure that only applications within the past 3 years are accessible. Users who want to access older applications will need to contact the Research Capability and Development team ( <a href='mailto:rcd@uts.edu.au'>rcd@uts.edu.au</a> ) </p><h4>APPROVAL FOR A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION TO BE ADDED TO THE LIBRARY</h4> <p>In giving approval for an application (whole or in part) to be included in the Library, the Lead Investigator/Applicant is acting on behalf of all named participants on the application in question. </p><p>The Lead Investigator/Applicant can request that sections of their grant application are redacted in the version of their application that is to be included in the Library by contacting the Research Capability and Development team (<a href='mailto:rcd@uts.edu.au'>rcd@uts.edu.au</a>) Sections can be redacted, or whole pages removed, as appropriate for the level of omission required.  </p><p>The Lead investigator/Applicant can request the removal of their grant from the Library at any time by contacting the Research Capability and Development Team (<a href='mailto:rcd@uts.edu.au'>rcd@uts.edu.au</a> ). </p><h4>RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE LIBRARY</h4>  <p>The Research Capability and Development team is responsible for the preparation of a copy of each application for upload into the Library. This includes: </p><ul><li>the redaction/omission of content as needed by request of the Lead Investigator/Applicant;</li><li>application of an â€˜Internal Onlyâ€™ watermark;</li><li>apply password protection, with restrictions on editing and printing;</li><li>and applying encryption to a copy of the file</li></ul><p>These measures, in conjunction with staff-only access to the Library, help ensure that content is available to help guide future grant applications whilst reducing the risk of copying content and release of sensitive information. </p><p>The Research Capability and Development team will liaise with eResearch to upload new applications to the Library and to coordinate structural changes to the Library.  </p><h4>CONDITIONS OF ACCESSING THE SUCCESSFUL GRANTS LIBRARY</h4>  <p>The Library is accessible to all UTS staff, including both academic and professional staff members. </p><p>The Library is not accessible to people external to UTS. </p><p>Applications included in the Library have been contributed by researchers to provide examples of successful funding, tender and prize/award applications for reference by UTS researchers when developing their own applications. General notes may be taken to help with framing, development, and layout of proposals.  </p><p>In accessing the Library, users agree not to copy or share the contents of the Library in any way.  </p><p>If content has been redacted or omitted from the online copy, users can contact the Lead Investigator/Applicant directly if there are any inquiries about the redacted content.  </p><h4>ACCESSING THE LIBRARY</h4>  <p>The Library can be accessed electronically by UTS staff using their staff ID via </p><ul><li>the â€˜Understanding Fundingâ€™ page on the RES Hub website (<a href='https://reshub.uts.edu.au/understanding-funding'>https://reshub.uts.edu.au/understanding-funding</a>);</li> <li>via Staff Connect (<a href='https://staff.uts.edu.au/topichub/Pages/Research/Funding%20your%20research/UTS%20Library%20of%20Successful%20Grants/uts-library-of-successful-grants.aspx'>Staff Connect - UTS Library of Successful Grants</a> );</li> <li>or via the Research Capability and Development team Sharepoint site.</li></ul><p>If you would like to access the Library whilst off-campus, you will need to connect to the UTS VPN.</p><h4>COMPLIANCE AND BREACHES</h4><p>The Research Office may suspend access to the Library for any person who breaches this procedure.</p>"
